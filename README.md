# haproxy
Auto-creation and validation of HA-proxy
How its work.
we will run the haprixy.sh and pass our backend  endpoint  and using this info it will trigger the python script which will generate a config file for you.
than we will create  docker images with your config will and run the container  and check if that is a valid file or not
